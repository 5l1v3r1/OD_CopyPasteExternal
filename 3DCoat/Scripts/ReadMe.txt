To Install, copy these files into the scripts folder in your 3dCoat documents folder.
Here, it is C:\Users\<username>\Documents\3D-CoatV47\Scripts.  Should you not have a
Scripts folder there, just copy the entire folder, otherwise, make a folder, in put the
files in there.

In 3DCoat, under the scripts tab, select Run Script, and select the two .txt files contained
here.  From that point on, they'll show up under the Script Menu and you can use them as is.

In case the path is DIFFERENT to 3d-CoatV47\scripts, change the path line in the scripts
themselves.  There's a line clearly marked, where you can adjust the path (in case of 3D-Coat
version changes, etc.)
